This repository contain 4 scripts that I used to make a RythmGame LevelDesign Tool.

In order to make a GeometryDash like videogame, we had to create 3 levels with a precise position given to the platform.
Indeed, the player to jump over/on platforms in rythm. So the position of platforms depends on player speed, player jump height and bpm/tempo. 

To make the leveldesign efficient and funnier, I searched how to use script in editor mode.
My research result to this 4 scripts that I will certainly update as I learn new things in programming and algorithm logic every weeks!

If you want to see how it works, you watch my 2023 DemoReel at this time code: https://youtu.be/XLdVM_z86U8?t=28
